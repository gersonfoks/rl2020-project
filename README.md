### Comparing off policy learning methods


In this project we compare off policy learning methods:
1) Ordinary importance sampling monte carlo
2) Weighted importance sampling monte carlo
3) Off-policy TD

In the dir "scripts" there is everything you need to perform the experiments.
In particular when you want to run an experiment you can use the code that is in the dir scripts/<envname\> to run the experiments
For example to run the blackjack experiment use :

`python -m scripts.blackjack.blackjack_experiment`
